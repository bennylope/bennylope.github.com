      <p>You were probably looking for a blog post and I went and moved the damn thing. I mean, I hired the 
        best people I could afford to take care of all the details and even so this kind of crap slips through. 
        Jesus Herbert Christ, III, PhD., DTh. It's not so much that it's difficult to find good people, it's 
        just a royal pain in the tuchus to fire the bad ones.</p>
      <p>So as I was saying, just go ahead and prefix 'tumblr.' before the top level domain up in your lil' 
        address bar up there and we'll be all good. Alright? Alright.</p>
      <p>Unless you're not looking for a missing blog post. In which case you should probably start looking
        through the Way Back Machine, starting from 1995 and working your way forward. It's probably in there
        somewhere.</p>
