History of Aspirin</font></font></font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#00CC00"></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Aspirin is a trade name for <font color="#FF0000">acetylsalicylic
acid</font>, a common analgesic.&nbsp; The earliest known uses of the drug
can be traced back to the Greek physician <font color="#FF0000">Hippocrates</font>
in the fifth century B.C.&nbsp; He used powder extracted from the bark
of willows to treat pain and reduce fever.</font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000">Salicin</font>, the
parent of the salicylate drug family, was successfully isolated in 1829
from willow bark.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Sodium salicylate</font>,
a predecessor to aspirin, was developed along with <font color="#FF0000">salicylic
acid</font> in 1875 as a pain reliever.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica"><font color="#FF0000">Sodium salicylate</font>
was not often popular though, as it has a habit of irritating the stomach.&nbsp;
However, in 1897, a man named <font color="#FF0000">Felix Hoffman</font>
changed the face of medicine forever.&nbsp; Hoffman was a German chemist
working for Bayer.&nbsp; He had been using the common pain reliever of
the time, sodium salicylate, to treat his father's arthritis.</font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">The sodium salicylate caused his father
the same stomach trouble it caused other people, so Felix decided to try
and concoct a less acidic formula.&nbsp; His work led to the synthesization
of <font color="#FF0000">acetylsalicylic acid</font>, or <font color="#FF0000">ASA</font>.&nbsp;
This soon became the pain killer of choice for physicians around the globe.</font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Scientists never really understood the
inner workings of the drug however.&nbsp; It wasn't until the 1970's, when
British pharmacologist <font color="#FF0000">John Vane, Ph.D.</font> began
work on aspirin that people began to understand how aspirin really works.&nbsp;
Vane and his colleagues found that aspirin inhibited the release of a hormone
like substance called <font color="#FF0000">prostaglandin</font>.&nbsp;
This chemical regulates certain body functions, such as blood vessel elasticity
and changing the functions of blood platelets.&nbsp; Thus can aspirin affect
blood clotting and ease inflammation.</font>
