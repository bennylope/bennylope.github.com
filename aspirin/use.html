Uses and Alternatives</font></font></font>

<p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Aspirin is an <font color="#FF0000">analgesic</font>,
meaning a drug that alleviates pain without affecting consciousness.&nbsp;
It is most commonly used for headaches, muscle pain, arthritis, and fever
reduction.&nbsp; Only recently, following the work of <font color="#FF0000">John
Vane Ph.D.</font>, has aspirin been recognized as a cardiological drug.</font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">It is commonly thought that aspirin hinders
<font color="#FF0000">prostaglandin</font> production and thus reduces
inflammation and pain.&nbsp; Prostaglandin affect the flow of blood platelets,
which are key in blood clotting.&nbsp; If plaque tears inside a coronary
artery, clotting begins at the site.&nbsp; This can cause <font color="#FF0000">cardiac
arrest</font> or a <font color="#FF0000">myocardial infarction</font>.&nbsp;
Today doctors can prescribe aspirin to patients with a history of heart
disease, and dramatically reduce that person's risk of a second event.</font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">As far as it's use as an analgesic, aspirin
has many alternatives.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Ibuprofen</font> is
one of the most common, and is marketed under such names as Motrin IB and
Advil.&nbsp; Ibuprofen is <font color="#FF0000">non-steroidal anti-inflammatory
drug</font> (NSAID) just as aspirin is.&nbsp; It has many of the same applications
as aspirin.&nbsp; <font color="#FF0000">Acetaminophen</font> is just as
common as aspirin or ibuprofen, and is marketed most commonly as Tylenol.&nbsp;
Acetaminophen does not carry the same side effects as aspirin or ibuprofen,
so is generally safer for a wider percentage of the population.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">Aspirin has many side effects that acetaminophen
and other pain relievers do not.&nbsp; It can induce gastro-intestinal
discomfort if taken in large enough doses.&nbsp; In children and adolescents
aspirin can cause <font color="#FF0000">Reye's syndrome</font> if taken
while the child is infected with a virus like chicken pox or influenza.</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">There are also more specialized drugs for
headaches and arthritis, including ketoprofen (Orudis KT) and naproxen
sodium (Aleve).</font><font face="Arial,Helvetica"></font>

</p><p><font face="Arial,Helvetica">In the future aspirin may become a common
place drug in the fight against cardiovascular disease.&nbsp; It's value
as preventive medicine for healthy people is already gaining ground in
the U.S.&nbsp; If we keep finding new uses for aspirin, it might just stay
around for another hundred years.</font>
