You have one goal each and everytime: just start. If you start, your
goal has been met.

If you don't finish your routine after you've started, at least you've
met your goal. This sounds like a cop-out but more than likely you'll be
able to motivate yourself just enough to keep going during your routine
(run, bike, climb, whatever). Just start
