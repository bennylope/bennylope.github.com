Shortly after I started my first job, and started getting paychecks and
managing actual expenses, I created my first personal finance
spreadsheet. I wanted a simple way of tracking how I spent, when and
what, essentially, and a spreadsheet afforded the most straightforward
way of doing this that I knew.

The spreadsheet was never a regular focus of my finances, but something
I would update every few months or so, populating the data with
electronic bank statement downloads or by plain old data entry. It was a
pain in the ass, but I didn't need to do it frequently.

I even gave some dedicated desktop programs a try, including Quicken and
Microsoft Money. While they were definitely cooler than my spreadsheet,
they were overkill and didn't really do much for me other than offer a
password for the data.

### Enter Wesabe

So I was excited when I discovered [Wesabe](http://www.wesabe.com). Wesabe was (the financial
management side of the site shut down a few years ago) a personal
finance site with a focus on community and a flexible money management
system based on tagging. It was easy to track spending down to the
penny and the social aspect of the site helped
engage people and created a friendly face for the service.

Updating my Wesabe data was a matter of entering transactions (for cash based
purchases, which were rare for Mr. Post-cash Economy dude) or uploading a bank
transaction file. The thing I liked most at the time was Wesabe's
completely customizable tagging interface for tracking expenditures,
rather than categories. This provided a lot of
flexibility and make updating transactions fast.

Of course, updating transactions - even when it takes only a few minutes - gets
to be a royal pain in the tuchus. So I gave Mint a try.


### Have a Mint

[Mint](http://www.mint.com) was somewhat similar to Wesabe, but the biggest
differentiator was that Mint scraped all your data for you. And its category
recognition was pretty good, based either on the merchant data in the
transaction or your own pattern of categorization. Switching from tags to a
hierarchal category system was a bit of a drag, but the categories were easy
enough to edit, and Mint got rid of the clunk category drop down in favor of a
suggested search text field. Now it didn't matter where in the category tree
your transaction existed.

I did have some more serious concerns adopting Mint, and those finally
contributed to why I deleted my account altogether.

As you can guess, if you want Mint to automatically scrape and update your data,
it needs access to your online bank accounts.

At the time I was trying it out I had also read some posts (probably on Hacker
News) about the security at Mint, and came away feeling relatively confident
that my access credentials were secure. Any worries I had later were smoothed
over by the slick convenience of the system.

Then a couple things happened. Mint was sold to Intuit and my primary bank
updated its site. The former meant nothing specific to me as a user. However,
even as a happy TurboTax online user, something didn't sit right with that
relationship. No concrete reason to which I could point. And my bank's updated
security meant that Mint was increasingly asking me the answers to my bank's
secret questions, which I'd never provided as something of a last ditch attempt
at maintaining control.

Two things finally convinced me to delete my account. One, I wasn't making
decisions based on my use of the site any longer. And two, I decided I needed to
winnow down the number of services I use in which I'm the product. Consumers
aren't really part of the information economy any more so much as they part of
the **personal information economy**, and I realized I didn't want that kind of
information (credentials and financial history) in the hands of someone for whom
I was not the customer.

<!--
* Saw Mint, better data import, slicker interface, categorization is yet
  easier
* Kind of missed tags, but very easy to manage categories and very easy
  to edit categories, which was important
* Missed the concept of adding transactions into a cash account however
  (probably not many people want down-to-the-penny management)
* So, no more downloading data, fairly easy connection and scraping
* This means giving over a lot of security credentials, somewhat
  worrying
* You are the product
* Easy to ignore offers, but I guess my credit is good enough and my
  current bank fees low enough or non-existent enough that the offers
  always sucked
* Like to maintain a *little* bit of security information not shared
* Only ING Direct provides a good, secure form of read-only data access

### Proprietary bank solutions

It's worth mentioning, if briefly, that some banks offer similiar
personal finance features through their consumer web sites. Bank of
America and USAA both allow you to link third-party bank accounts and
provide aggregate transaction data.

I don't remember ever giving the Bank of America service a try, and
likely passed it over without a consideration given the terrible interface
they'd provided elsewhere. USAA had a pretty good web interface and
compared to other banks I have a high level of trust in USAA. So it was
worth giving it a go, but turns out that personal finance management
software - interfaces, especially - is something demanding a pretty deep
commitment.

The USAA personal finance management interface consists of a set of
rigid categories and largely meaningless pie charts. While USAA is good
at banking, turns out they're not that good at interface design.

### Hello, HelloWallet

The latest service I've tried is [HelloWallet](http://www.hellowallet.com), which bills itself
less as a straight money tracker and more as a financial guidance service. It's
got two big things going for it, so far as I'm concerned. One, [it's
proudly made in DC](http://proudlymadeindc.com/), and two, it's a paid
service. Yes, that's a benefit. Since I'm the one paying them, I'm the
one to whom they have responsibility. There are no affiliates or
advertisers in the mix.

On paper I love HelloWallet. The customer incentives are in the right
place, the service is focused on helping customers achieve financial
goals, and they actually have people driven customer service.

But the lifeblood of any financial management system is still
transaction data. Budgets and goals are meaningless if you don't know
how you're tracking, and you don't know how you're tracking unless your
transactions are accurate, up to date, and propertly categorized. It's
the last part where HelloWallet made me pull my hair.

Identifying the nature of a transaction from bank data is really hard,
and so predictive categorization is only so accurate. This is to be
expected, and it's one reason why every piece of personal finance
software I've ever seen lets you edit the transaction category. The
other reason they let you do this is that everyone has their own way of
thinking about and measuring their finances. Spending at coffee shops
may be an entertainment expense to one person and a food expense to
another. I've always thought of coffee expenses in the latter category,
while HelloWallet sticks them in the former.

Both the built-in category structure and the method for
updating transactions in HelloWallet feel broken to me, or at least very
incomplete. Editing transaction categories is really hard, or at least
significantly harder than it needs to be. 

The built-in categories feel a bit off and overly rigid. I've already
mentioned the "Coffee shops" categorization. Then there's the top-level
"Children" category. If most customers have children then a
default top level category for children might make sense, but it'd also
make sense to let everyone else remove that category. You can't edit or
remove built-in categories. As it were, I think of children's clothes as
a subcategory of clothing, although that makes it harder to later show
your children in aggregate just how much they've cost you!

Every application and service comes with minor annoyances to at least
some users. In the case of updating transaction categories it's a
matter of usability, not just for the interface but for the application
as a whole. I really want to like HelloWallet again, and these problems
are solvable, so I'm hopeful that the team there will address them. I'd
happily come back.

### Personal finance software tomorrow

From the systems I've used so far, something mixing the HelloWallet
business model with Mint's data interface would come closest to the
ideal.

Because the ideal system is one in which keeping your transaction
history up to date and accurate is frictionless, the system adapts to your personal
financial model, and it stays one step ahead of you, keeping you out of
trouble and on track to your goals.

Maybe that's [Simple](http://www.simple.com) (ne√© BankSimple), although not having had the
opportunity to use it yet, I'm not really sure how it fits into your
personal finances in conjunction with third party accounts.
