    They tried turning specifications into user stories. You'll never
    guess how much money they spent cleaning it up.

It starts innocently enough. A few mockups, some user flows, a form that
everyone loves, an application born of high quality design. A beautiful
application that looks exactly like it was supposed to and providing
little of the intended value.

### Specifications: no substitute for requirements

Confusing requirements and specifications is a common mistake
in early stage projects. Having spent weeks, months or possibly
even years thinking about the end product it's not surprising that
clients have a preconceived notion of exactly what their application is
going to look like, how exactly each part should work.

When we put together a project plan and you start developing, there are
two ways to do it: there are specs and requirements. Requirements are
the 'what's necessary' question. What do you need to do? Specifications
are the 'how.' How are you going to do that?

So just what are the differences between specifications and
requirements?

### The destination is not the route

Consider this scenario. You're out on the street in Istanbul preparing
to head to the Istanbul Modern to take in some Turkish art prior to
leaving the next day. It seems fairly far away and you don't have your
own car, so you find a taxi to get there.

The first thing you probably do after getting in the taxi is tell the
driver where you want to go. You've seen the map and can tell which
streets directly get you there, but you don't need to tell the driver
which roads to take. Or perhaps you do and find yourself sitting in a
traffic jam after arguing with the driver not to take his preferred
route, the one that went around the traffic jam he expected along your
preferred route.

What you're doing in telling the driver the destination
is providing requirements. Requesting a specific
route is providing specifications. Instead you could provide your
requirements to the driver, that you want
to get to museum and you'd like to get there by 2 o'clock. Now your
driver can take this information and based on his knowledge of the city
and its traffic patterns decide what route to take to ensure your
requirements are met. Even with your map of the city and feigned
knowledge your own specifications here almost certainly having failed.

If you happen to know all the winding roads in the city of seven hills that
might work out for you, but chances are pretty good the only outcome
from specifying your route rather than simply providing your destination
is going to be a slower trip, at best.

**Requirements are destinations, specifications are routes.**

### Requirements and goals

It's possible, too, that our driver might have told us that given the
traffic congestion, our limited time, and short distance, that it would
be in our interest to walk or perhaps take a different mode of
transport.

On the street in Instanbul we stopped short in talking only about
requirements. Here we're still relying on the driver as only a technical
expert to decide on and navigate a route through the city's narrow and
congested streets. We arrived on time at the museum but were somewhat
underwhelmed by the museum. Had we discussed our *goals* with the driver
this might have been a different outcome.

Our goal was to enjoy some
Turkish art in the one afternoon we had left. Implicit in this at least
is that we want to get the best and most unique experience in the
shortest amount of time. If we knew that our driver knew something not
just about driving cars, not just about choosing routes through the
city, but also about the city itself, including it's museums, we could
have added the purpose, the goal of our trip.

Now with the driver's aid
we might have gone to a different museum altogether. "An afternoon in
Istanbul? No, no, you want the Muesum of Islamic Art!" We're skeptical
but take the driver's advice anyhow and are surprised
by how absorbed one can become just in tiling alone.

### Making this possible

This kind discovery is only possible with expertise and trust. As a
consultant it means making sure your clients know about your expertise
and asking questions when they specify routes. As a client it means
going beyond specifying a route and explaining where you're trying to go
and also why you're trying to get there.
