title: "Will You Work For Equity?"

It's been a while since the question has been put seriously to me, "will
you work for equity?" but it's something I 

1. Earnest cash up front
2. Funding
3. Solid business and team

A serious cash payment is still important. It's critical as a signal, to
fund development/invovlement/work, and it's important that the company -
the client - have some skin in the game too.

Funding of some sort is important to make sure that someone else has
vetted the company. It also means there's a lifeline.

The last one incredibly important. When you work for equity you're
basically making an investment in the client. Is this a business that
you feel comfortable banking on? Do you trust the business plan, and
more importantly, do you trust the team?

All of these things aligning is pretty rare, suffice to say I've not
taken anyone up on the offer of working for equity.
