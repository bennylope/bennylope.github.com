    This is a running and in-progress compendium of educational resources I've found useful running a small consultancy.

NOTE: Very much in progress but published by request as its still moderately useful.

### Books

Let's get this out of the way: most business books are bad. Like, really bad. These books, not all business books,
are not bad. They're not perfect, but they're each sufficiently useful in their own way.

#### Flawless Consulting

#### Million Dollar Consulting

#### The Positioning Manual

#### Hourly Billing is Nuts

#### Design Is A Job

> Fuck you, pay me. [Mike Monteiro]

This is a book for designers. It's also for people who aren't designers. If
you work with (partner with) designers or do anything vaguely creative - which
includes software development - this is worth a read.

> This book is a guide to making a living as a designer. It contains the
> fundamentals of being a working designer, including working with clients and
> others, valuing your work, and getting paid. This book will look at ways to
> communicate and apply these fundamentals to every aspect of your job. The goal
> is to expand your view of your job as a designer to include not just your
> talent, but the business and communication aspects as well.

#### Independent Consulting Manual

#### Lean Customer Development

#### Little Red Schoolhouse

You write emails and documents to your clients and consisently fail to get the responses - and results - that you'd like.
This is because you're writing for you and you're not motiviating the problem for your client, the cost of the problem to
your client, how you'll solve the problem for your client, and the benefits to your client of your proposed solution.
If you keep writing like this you're going to continue on your hamster wheel of frustration. Instead, try reworking
your writing along these suggested lines and over time you'll start to see radically different responses from your
clients that result in improved outcomes for them, and a better freelancing business for you.

Notice what I did there?

Don't think you can find this book on Amazon. This is compendium of handouts and worksheets from a [college writing curriculum](http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/schoolhouse/WP/index.html) called,
you guessed it, the Little Red Schoolhouse. Originally developed in the English department at the University of Chicago, I had the
pleasure of taking an [upper level writing course](http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/schoolhouse/WP/380main.html) taught by Greg Colomb and Jon D'Errico
at the University of Virginia based on Colomb's experience teaching at Chicago. You'd be hard pressed to find a better guide to effective writing.

#### Man's Search for Meaning

Another non-business book. A two part book including Viktor Frankl's personal account of surviving life in Nazi concentration camps and finding meaning
in deprevation and amid the loss of everything you hold dear (Frankl lost almost his entire family, including his wife). The second part of the book
is an extension of the memoir, in which as a psychiatrist he outlines his existential philosophy of analysis, called logotherapy. I first read this book
at a low point in my personal and early 'professional' life - the timing was coincidental - and its both a sad and inspiring story. Striking out on your
own is an amazingly freeing experience, but we often fail to recognize the responsibilities and weight that come with freedom until we're at a point
so low it looks like there's no way out.

I'll [badly] paraphrase an anecote I loosely recall from the book to coarsely illustrate the philosophy:

> Patient: Dr. Frankl, my life is terrible, I wake up daily and think about killing myself.

> Frankl: What's stopping you?

> Patient: ?

> Frankl: Why don't you kill yourself?

> Patient: If I did that my children would be left alone without their mother, my grandchildren would never have an opportunity to know their grandmother...

> Frankl: You don't need my help. Go see your grandchildren.

The point is not to contrast your superficial "first world" struggles with that of life in Auschwitz ("You got it so great kid!") but to remind yourself
that you have both freedom and *responsibility* for how you face the world and the meaning you find, and make in it. It's a cold dip in the ocean compared
to the milquetoast inspirational quotes your friends like to share on Facebook.

### Podcasts

#### The Freelancer's Show

[The Freelancer's Show](https://devchat.tv/freelancers) is hands down my favorite 'freelancing' related podcast. I'm using three main criteria:

1. Useful and applicable information
2. Engaging topics and speakers (hosts and guests)
3. Easy to listen to (technical issues, quality, etc).

This podcast is geared toward *freelance developers* so may be less relevant to
people working in other disciplines. The hosts include a regular circle who
bring different experiences, both technical and business. Whether they have a
guest or not you get different perspectives even when everyone's in agreement.

Good for strategic and tactical advice, as well as being a great outlet to feel
like you're not struggling through a problem on your own.

Selected episode: [Giving Advice Away For Free](https://devchat.tv/freelancers/203-fs-giving-advice-away-for-free)

#### Making Money Online

You may not like this podcast. And that's okay. The hosts, they won't care. It
took me a little while to warm up to to it. It's weird. But I like weird things,
so here we are. Nick swears a lot. I like swearing. Unless you're Samuel L
Jackson you probably can't get away with saying 'fuck' in every sentence and not
sounding like an asshole though. Salty language is just that, salt that helps
flavor our prose, and like salt there's an optimal quantity before it overwhelms
the total flavor of the dish. Whatever. It is a good podcast though, really.

The hosts, Kai and Nick, are both *independent consultants* and the episodes range over topics
related to life as a freelancer, er, independent consultant, and the business of
running your own consulting business.

Selected episode: [How You Signify To People What You Do](https://makemoneyonline.exposed/archive/036/)

(Note: in one otherwise helpful episode Nick yells at you that you must
*necessarily* be on W2 payroll to secure a home mortgage; we know that if the
existential quantifier is true then the universal quantifier for the inverse
must be false, ergo this is not necessarily true. It is certainly *easier* to
secure a mortage with W2 statements but any lender is going to know that its
still your business. Further if you're paying yourself on payroll then you'd
better be doing that because you're filing as an S corp in which case unless
you're truly a million dollar consultant you're likely not paying yourself *in
salary* toward the upper end of the pay scale, if you know what I mean, so
the dollar value of your W2 payments won't be that high.)

#### Stacking The Bricks

#### Tropical MBA

The [Tropical MBA](http://www.tropicalmba.com/) is a hit or miss podcast if
you're looking for material relevant to freelancing. It's core audience is
location independent (think a beach in Southeast Asia) entrepreneurs building
product businesses. That said there's a reasonable degree of overlap if you pick
your episodes, and it's one of the best produced podcasts I've listened to. That
sounds like such a superficial compliment but there's a small joy in hearing the
back and forth move smoothly like a practiced ballet.

The selected episode won't teach you how to get better clients, sorry. It's just
a terribly good episode ranging over various topics with an interesting thinker.

Selected episode: [A Conversation With Ribbonfarm's Venkat Rao](http://www.tropicalmba.com/ribbonfarm/)

#### Kalzumeus Software

An infrequent podcast and one only incidentally related to freelancing. This is
patio11's podcast, or Patrick McKenzie if you prefer. The podcast is primarily
geared toward an audience of software developers and solo founders but a great
deal of the content (customer onboarding, [balancing business and
family](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2015/01/15/kalzumeus-podcast-episode-10-putting-the-family-in-family-business/)) is
pertinent to the independent consultant and freelancer.

Selected episode: [Teaching As Marketing](http://www.kalzumeus.com/2013/08/27/kalzumeus-podcast-episode-6/)

#### Double Your Freelancing Podcast

#### Freelance Transformation

#### Ditching Hourly

#### The Three Month Vacation

#### The Businessology Show

#### Bizcraft

[Bizcraft](http://unmatchedstyle.com/bizcraft) is, as best I can tell, d-e-d dead, but for a while it was one of my
favorite business podcasts. The setup is Carl Smith of nGen Works and Gene
Crawford of Period Three discussing various aspects of running agencies, usually
over beers. I'm not sure how early in the day they started recording.

Selected episode: [Next Steps, Working Too Hard & Time](http://unmatchedstyle.com/news/bizcraft-episode-32.php)
