    This is a running and in-progress compendium of educational resources I've found useful running a small consultancy.

NOTE: Very much in progress but published by request as its still moderately useful.

### Books

Let's get this out of the way: most business books are bad. Like, really bad. These books, not all business books,
are not bad. They're not perfect, but they're each sufficiently useful in their own way.

#### Flawless Consulting

#### Million Dollar Consulting

#### The Positioning Manual

#### Hourly Billing is Nuts

#### Design Is A Job

#### Independent Consulting Manual

#### Lean Customer Development

#### Little Red Schoolhouse

You write emails and documents to your clients and consisently fail to get the responses - and results - that you'd like.
This is because you're writing for you and you're not motiviating the problem for your client, the cost of the problem to
your client, how you'll solve the problem for your client, and the benefits to your client of your proposed solution.
If you keep writing like this you're going to continue on your hamster wheel of frustration. Instead, try reworking
your writing along these suggested lines and over time you'll start to see radically different responses from your
clients that result in improved outcomes for them, and a better freelancing business for you.

Notice what I did there?

Don't think you can find this book on Amazon. This is compendium of handouts and worksheets from a [college writing curriculum](http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/schoolhouse/WP/index.html) called,
you guessed it, the Little Red Schoolhouse. Originally developed in the English department at the University of Chicago, I had the
pleasure of taking an [upper level writing course](http://www.faculty.virginia.edu/schoolhouse/WP/380main.html) taught by Greg Colomb and Jon D'Errico
at the University of Virginia based on Colomb's experience teaching at Chicago. You'd be hard pressed to find a better guide to effective writing.

#### Man's Search for Meaning

Another non-business book. A two part book including Viktor Frankl's personal account of surviving life in Nazi concentration camps and finding meaning
in deprevation and amid the loss of everything you hold dear (Frankl lost almost his entire family, including his wife). The second part of the book
is an extension of the memoir, in which as a psychiatrist he outlines his existential philosophy of analysis, called logotherapy. I first read this book
at a low point in my personal and early 'professional' life - the timing was coincidental - and its both a sad and inspiring story. Striking out on your
own is an amazingly freeing experience, but we often fail to recognize the responsibilities and weight that come with freedom until we're at a point
so low it looks like there's no way out.

I'll [badly] paraphrase an anecote I loosely recall from the book to coarsely illustrate the philosophy:

> Patient: Dr. Frankl, my life is terrible, I wake up daily and think about killing myself.

> Frankl: What's stopping you?

> Patient: ?

> Frankl: Why don't you kill yourself?

> Patient: If I did that my children would be left alone without their mother, my grandchildren would never have an opportunity to know their grandmother...

> Frankl: You don't need my help. Go see your grandchildren.

The point is not to contrast your superficial "first world" struggles with that of life in Auschwitz ("You got it so great kid!") but to remind yourself
that you have both freedom and *responsibility* for how you face the world and the meaning you find, and make in it. It's a cold dip in the ocean compared
to the milquetoast inspirational quotes your friends like to share on Facebook.

### Podcasts

#### The Freelancer's Show

[The Freelancer's Show](https://devchat.tv/freelancers) is hands down my favorite 'freelancing' related podcast. I'm using three main criteria:

1. Useful and applicable information
2. Engaging topics and speakers (hosts and guests)
3. Easy to listen to (technical issues, quality, etc).

This podcast is geared toward *freelance developers* so may be less relevant to people working in other disciplines. The hosts include a regular circle who bring different
experiences, both technical and business, and without a
