In practice SharePoint tends to **encourage information "stovepiping"
and the accumulation of information in non-permeable form** (i.e. big
dumb files).

Comparing SharePoint to, say, MediaWiki, SharePoint is much easier for
most users to approach. There's no markup language to learn to start
using it, no implied way of organizing information. However because
SharePoint relies on so many of the same metaphors as single-user
desktop computing (e.g. file folders) it doesn't encourage users to
approach it any differently as a knowledge repository.

As an enterprise tool it's designed to be feature rich to accommodate
the diverse needs of a large organization, and this includes permission
controls. The ability to control access to certain types of information
is necessary for specific business groups (HR) however in practice
**permission controls are over adopted by users who want to protect
their little pockets of knowledge**. True, this might look better than
this information never being "shared" anywhere, but it does nothing for
organizational knowledge.

The second criticism is that most users approach SharePoint first and
foremost as a central, slick-looking file repository. The team behind
SharePoint probably had and has much greater ambitions than this, but
the average user when presented with the option to continue doing things
the same way will, and that way is uploading files. Knowledge in
centrally available files is better than none, but not by much. For an
organization it's of **magnitudes greater value if knowledge products
are in an immediately readable, searchable, and malleable format**. The
small up front effort to write or even paste information into a wiki
page yields dividends when other people in the organization are required
to open bloated PowerPoint decks looking for the answer.

As a bonus, the intentional editing required of a wiki usually yields
superior organization and quality of content.

This is based on some observations of SharePoint in the wild (prior to
the latest version), not based on technological capabilities or the
intent behind certain product features. **I do not think the intended
design for how an application will be used is all that important if it
is consistently used in a contrary manner**. It's also important to note
that even some wiki products allow for permission controlling wiki pages
and groups of wiki pages (e.g. Confluence).

Regarding the choice of MediaWiki for this comparison, I've watched
non-technical users (the kind that only know MS Word, PowerPoint, and
"Yahoo") learn to use MediaWiki to collaborate on projects within and
beyond the enterprise while flailing to do anything useful on SharePoint
beyond upload files.
