This is what I saw today when I opened up our QuickBooks online dashboard:

It's supposed to be a quick snapshot of invoices. And it should be. But instead
its a tiny little gem of confusion.

* If red means overdue, and there are no overdue invoices, why is there a red bar?
* Why do red and yellow overlap?
* Why is the red and yellow combination longer than the green, for which there are more invoices?
* What's with the competing "Last 30 days" and "Last 365 days" labels?

This graphic gets it all wrong.

A dashboard exists only for this reason: to provide the most important
'actionable' information in an easily digestible manner. All kinds of
requirements flow from this. It should not be any more complicated than
necessary. There should be no extraneous verbiage. Color, size, and shape
differences all matter.

Here are some simple fixes to start.

![A simple fix](/images/quickbooks-invoice-simplefix.png)

* No overdue invoices? No red visual indicator.
* Horizontal bars are proportional (ish) to their numeric value.
* The useless 'Last 365 Days' label is gone.

If nothing else, it's less confusing.

For every piece of additional information added you need to ask yourself, what
is this communicating, and what will we do with this communicated information?
