Taleo is enterprise software. With any enterprise software **momentum**
is usually a good starting answer. Replacing not just the software but
the support infrastructure and the processes that have evolved around a
specific piece of software in an enterprise is costly (time, money, and
patience).

The other reason is that the people making the decision to keep it are
rarely the people who have to use it. Their decisions are informed my
marketing materials, some demos, feedback from people in the company
(who also will probably not be heavy users, if at all), and possibly
from industry assessments (like Gartner) which are also not based on
heavy, day-to-day use. The decisions are also made heavily based on
features (no matter how useless to the end user in day-to-day work).
This is a general explanation regarding enterprise software. Notice that
at no point are candidates involved in the cycle.

There are alternatives (What are the alternatives to Taleo?). At the
enterprise level these include Kenexa and Jobvite, and there are
additional products geared toward smaller companies and startups. We've
been working on our own, [HireCatalyst](http://hirecatalyst.com/) to
introduce simple job publishing and even social profile application,
from LinkedIn to GitHub.
