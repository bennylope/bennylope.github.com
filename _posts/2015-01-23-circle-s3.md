    It's easy to take a Jekyll site and deploy to GitHub pages. But what
    if you don't want to deploy to GitHub? Or you'd rather use a
    different generating program? Using Jekyll as the example here's a
    step-by-step for setting up S3 hosting and using Circle CI to
    automatically deploy.

---

The specifics here are illustrated using a Jekyll site, but it should be
trivial to substitute your static site generator of choice.

### A publishing script

We're going to start with a publishing script. This is something that
would make life simpler for a team sharing this with or without a CI
tool deploying the site, and for a single user as well. The script is
going to target our S3 bucket and use the [AWS CLI
tool](http://aws.amazon.com/cli/) to sync the contents of the build
directory to the bucket.

The script is *also* going to specify the AWS profile to use. If you
work with multiple AWS accounts the AWS CLI lets you configure different
profiles with respective credentials, so you can access business,
client, or personal accounts from the same system user account. This
script presumes there's an existing AWS profile named 'companyprofile'.

{% highlight bash %}
#!/usr/bin/env bash
DEFAULT="companyprofile"
PROFILE=${AWS_PROFILE:-$DEFAULT}
BUCKET=my-s3-bucket
DIR=_site/
aws  s3  sync $DIR s3://$BUCKET/ --profile "$PROFILE"
{% endhighlight %}

The profile here is what we'd expect the developer or anyone else on the
team to be using from their local environments. It's trivial to change
this via an environment variable in the CI environment (or a local
environment).

The point of the script is to make it dead simple for a person to
publish and to allow a CI server to do the same using the same script.

### Use a distinct IAM user

If you're a new AWS user you may be tempted to just log into the AWS
console and grab your API credentials - DO NOT DO THIS. You're going to
create a user just for this deployment with its own credentials for
limiting access.

All you need to do is create the user via the IAM console. Go to
[Identity and Access
Management](https://console.aws.amazon.com/iam/home), 'Users', and then
create new.

Make sure you download or copy the credentials after you create the
account, and then hold on to them. We're not going to set any
permissions or groups for this user, so don't worry about any of that.
We'll use a bucket policy for access management instead - more on that
below.

### Configuring Circle

Circle CI is primarily a build tool, but we're going to take advantage of
its deployment capabilities. The main benefit to using a CI service or
other remote deployment service is that it makes it easier for a larger
team to work on a project. You only need to provide access to the source
repository, and then let your automated tooling do the rest.

You configure your build with a YAML file. Here's our stripped down
build definition.

{% highlight yaml %}
dependencies:
    override:
        - bundle install
        - sudo pip install awscli

deployment:
    aws:
    branch: master
        commands:
        - jekyll build
        - /bin/bash publish.sh
{% endhighlight %}

You should also add your new AWS user's credentials to your Circle
account. Luckily there's a feature just for handing AWS credentials.

Open your project settings and find the link for "AWS Credentials".
Enter the AWS key id and secret key that you downloaded earlier here.
With the publishing script presented here you'd need to specify a
different AWS profile in your environment, and you can do that in either
the Circle build configuration file or in the project settings.

### Creating your bucket

You can create your bucket from the [AWS management
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home). The management console
will let you set up static web hosting as well.

Select 'Enable website hosting' and update the index and error document
fields. Almost done here.

### Adding a bucket policy

The new user won't be able to add anything to the bucket, and you won't
be able to see the site publicly without a bucket policy. This is the
permission policy that governs who can do what for a given resource or
set of resources, in this case our bucket and its contents.

The policy needs to allow 3 things:

1. For anyone to be able to get an object in the bucket
2. For the CI user to be able to list the bucket's contents
3. For the CI user to be able to modify objects in the bucket (get, add,
   delete)

The presumption here is that any user you might be using locally has the
rights via a user permission or group. If not, and you want to deploy
locally as well, then you'll need to add permissions for additional
users to your bucket policy.

      "Sid": "Stmt1421785119791",

      "Effect": "Allow",

      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "*"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1421785171613",
      "Action": [
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-bucket",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::accountId:user/circle-s3-user"
        ]
      }
    },
    {
      "Sid": "Stmt1421745246135",
      "Action": [
        "s3:DeleteObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:GetObjectVersion",
        "s3:PutObject"
      ],
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:s3:::my-s3-bucket/*",
      "Principal": {
        "AWS": [
          "arn:aws:iam::accountId:user/circle-s3-user"
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}
{% endhighlight %}

This is based on a policy created using the [AWS Policy Generator
tool](http://awspolicygen.s3.amazonaws.com/policygen.html).
