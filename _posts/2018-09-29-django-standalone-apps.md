    Introducing the very belated and still in-progress Django Standalone Apps fieldguide.
---

A few years back I had an idea. I'd write a series of blog posts specific to things I'd learned - often the hard way - about to create and manage Django standalone apps. A few draft posts turned into a few more and it occurred to me that what I had in front of me was basically a book. So I'd write a book!

As my father would say, "famous last words".

Much progress was rapidly made on the book and the life caught up with me. Books are the kind of thing I think that you need to either attack in full or with a carefully orchestrated long term campaign, inbetween strategies don't work well.

At any rate, in order to get it finished I've decided to eschew the self-publishing (Leanpub) method and just post it to my own site. I'll offer an ebook when there's a polished version, but in the meantime hopefully the material here will prove useful to someone else.

You can read the in-progress version at [/django-standalone-apps/](/django-standalone-apps/)

It's worth noting that some of the original material was written _three years ago_. I've worked on it here and there since then, but some of the content deserves a significant update. I'm currently going through sections and either editing to make it publishable or updating/writing the content (as there were some holes despite the detailed outline).

If there's something you think that should be updated or is questionable, I'd love any and all feedback: ben@benlopatin.com.
