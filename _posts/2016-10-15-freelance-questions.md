    questions new business owners waste time on that have
    straightforward answers.

This is a compendium of *my answers* to common questions about setting
up a business as an independent consultant or freelancer. Many of these
are simply the best and most straightforward answer. They come from
several years of running a consulting partnership and somehow managing
to not sink it.

These are questions that are largely *necessary* but hardly sufficient
to running a good business. People like to get caught up in these
anyhow, so if you're spinning your wheels thinking about what to do you
could do much worse than following the advice here and focusing your
energy instead on things like finding clients and working on those
relationships.

- Incorporating your business
- Getting money (invoicing customers)
- Managing money (bank accounts and bookkeeping)
- Paying yourself
- Paying the state

Note that some of this - especially tax or corporation related - may
apply only or mainly to people operating in the United States and
further that I am neither a lawyer nor a CPA.

## Incorporating your business

**If you're running a solo business then the best course of action is to
set up a Limited Liability Corporation (LLC).** Ensure that everything
is owned by the business and that all legal relationships are to the
business, not you personally.

*That's the advice. That's it.* What follows is a discussion about the
alternatives we're rejecting and more detailed options for the future.

The alternatives are, one, to operate as a "naked" sole proprietor, that is,
running everything in your name, perhaps with a trade name (DBA, or
doing business as), or two, create a C corporation.

> I've heard about S corporations and B corporations, what about those?

First of all, a B corporation is not a legally recognized distinction.
It's a stamp of approvoal, like a "Fair Trade" label on food, offered by
an indepenent organization promoting certain socially conscious business
practices.

In practical terms, you probably don't need to worry about B
corporation as an independent consultant.

An S corporation, on the other hand, is a legally recognized term, but importantly,
*does not define the formation of the corporation*. This is is a critical
distinction! S corporation is simply a tax filing status, which a
corporation may elect - either a C corp or an LLC - that ensures that
for tax purposes the corporation is treated as a pass through.

In practical terms this means that as an LLC owner, you can pay yourself
a moderate salary and then take the remaining profit as dividends,
meaning it is taxed at the dividend tax rate regardless of your upper
tax bracket and that it is not subject to FICA tax (for non-US readers
FICA includes our Social Security and Medicare taxes).

When should you elect S corp status? Probably not right away. Jason
Blumer, a CPA who hosts a podcast about business for "creatives",
recommends 80k as the baseline number for making this change. He has a
[video explaining how the tax savings work](https://vimeo.com/59256380)
as well. You will need to have your books in good order and work with a
CPA to do this. It shouldn't cost more than a few hundred dollars. You
can elect to do this later in the year if your CPA follows the late
filing procedures.

## Invoicing customers

**Use a paid, professional invoicing service that will let clients pay
online.** We have used several over the years and have been very happy
with Harvest ([referral link](http://try.hrv.st/2-46886) - gives you and
me $10 Harvest credit) but almost any
of the services will work.

Beyond this, I wrote an entire [post just about billing
customers](/invoicing-for-web-developers/). It's a tiny bit out of date -
Zencash has gone the way of the Tasmanian wolf - but everything else
is just as pertinent. In summary:

- Make it easy for cusotmers to pay you. If you can't afford the cost of
  payment processing to accept credit cards with Stripe or PayPal you are
  charging too little.
- You are not a bank. We have used net-15 terms since
  we started the business, with one-person clients and large national
  organizations. If this is a problem for a client you now have a
  negotiating position to change it to net-30 if its lucrative or you
  like them. *Never go beyond net-30.* If you are billing against
  milestones then terms are net-X and no work starts/continues until
  payment.
- Late fees are not worth it. It's nickle and diming your clients.
  Clients are typically late because their attention is elsewhere (talk to
  them, they'll probably pay right away) or because they're bastards who
  don't pay their vendors (get your money and stop working for them).
  A third option is they have cash flow problems. Either you try to get
  your money and stop working for them or you learn to live with this if
  you really like working with them.

## Managing your money - banking and bookkeeping

**At a bare minimum set up a checking account in your business's name.
Either get a debit card or open a credit card in your business's name
for office expenditures, subscription services, etc. Use an accounting
service or bookkeeping software that uses double-entry bookkeeping.**

Let's talk about bookkeping first. You have basically three options: do
it yourself, hire a bookkeeper, or use a "service" that does this for
you. I put service in quotes because the only one I've seen to date -
Bench - still has a person behind the scenes. If you can afford it, hire
a bookeeper. It's not a bad idea to start managing the books yourself -
with help if necessary - to make sure you understand how bookkeeping
works. If you can do it yourself, go ahead, again, at least to start
with.

The software? It all sucks in one way or another.

Nobody got fired for choosing IBM, and you won't cause any hearburn with
a bookkeeper if you're using QuickBooks.

If you're solo, you have more options. As a
solo business owner you can probably get away with just the basic
equity accounts - that is, how you track ownership. In a partnership you
need to track multiple equity accounts and this precludes many software
packages.

If you're doing the books yourself, you like doing the books, and you
live on the command line, the absolute best accounting software is
Ledger or one of its various clones (for personal finance I use hledger,
a Ledger compatible program that happens to be written in Haskell).
They're all based on [a plain text storage
format](http://plaintextaccounting.org/).

## Paying yourself

**When you start out take as little as possible, and just take draws.
Once you have traction it makes sense to file as an S corp (in the US)
and take a modest salary.**

Our first CPA's advice when we started out was just that: don't do a
salary, keep it simple and take draws as necessary. He was pretty
emphatic about that. There's no financial benefit to you to pay yourself
a W-2 salary if you're still subject to normal tax rates on the profit,
including self employment and FICA.

## Paying the government

**Killing vampires is cool, but don't be like Wesley Snipes. Pay your
taxes. Make estimated payments each quarter because a single large bill
with fines is not fun.**

The best way to pay these taxes is by being on payroll and filing as an
S corp. You don't have to think [too much] about making these payments,
plus the whole benefit of lower taxes on everything else.

With that out the way...

**What follows is risky advice that responsible people should take with
a grain of salt. Remember how I said I'm not a CPA?**

Especially when we started out, and weren't on payroll, I erred on the
side of caution and underpaid the quarterly estimated payment, keeping the remainder in
savings (business or personal). The reason was uncertainty about future
cash flow (even if you'll get a refund because you overpaid that's
cash you don't have during the year). The result was a higher tax bill
in April with a small fine for underpayment. The fine was small enough
that it was worth the optionality of having that cash on hand.
