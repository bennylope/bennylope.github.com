You could provide several answers related to a reliance on individual
automobiles (inefficient road use, urban sprawl), but I'd like to focus
on just one: **automobile parking**.

We need lots of space for parking idle cars. Because our trips do not
involve displacing a car in one location for a replacement in the
origin, we need space for more cars than are on the road. If you think
about parking as an inventory system, it's very difficult to get away
with a "just in time" system. You needs lots of excess capacity.

Stadiums are good examples (putting aside whether their use is
efficient). Modern stadiums have thousands of parking spaces that just
lay empty most of the time. Here's RFK Stadium in Washington, DC. You
can see a portion of the parking lots surrounding the stadium. This is
not in exurbia, you can see the Capitol in the background.

Street parking can be turned into additional traffic lanes and parking
lots can be used for events, but these use cases are not the norm.

Parking isn't just a space issue, it also reflects on our use of
automobiles as a "fleet". Parked cars are idle cars. This dully obvious
point is important! So that we can get from our dispersed suburban homes
to wherever we want to go whenever we want to go, we maintain our own
individual fleets of cars. It is certainly convenient, but not terribly
efficient.
