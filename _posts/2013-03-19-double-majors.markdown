If you want to be a business person with a bit of knowledge of
engineering, go for it. **If you want to be a competent engineer who can
create a business, don't double major in engineering and business.** Stick
to the engineering degree.

Let's first back track to your goal, which is to create a business
focused on rotobotics and nanotechnolgoy. That's an awesomely ambitious
goal! What do you think you will gain from each major? And what role do
you want to play in this business?

**It's unlikely that either degree will fully prepare you for either the
engineering required to develop new products in nanotechnology or to
start and run a business.** However the base level of knowledge you need
of engineering is significantly higher than the base level required of
business, and you're unlikely to pick up all that much of value in the
classroom worth directly applying to a brand new business. The business
major will be a distraction to the one that matters.

Think about those two questions I posed, and then consider this: you
should probably hold a job or two out of college before launching your
business. Most people drastically overestimate how much their formal
education will prepare them for "the real world" and similarly
underestimate the value of education gained from regular old jobs. Find
a company with a good engineering track record and work there for a
couple of years. Get some first hand experience designing and building
things in the real world, with real constraints, real products, and real
customers. Note what works, what doesn't, what you could improve. Learn,
learn, learn. Then go launch your venture.
