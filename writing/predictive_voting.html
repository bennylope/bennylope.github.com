    <h1>Predictive Voting</h1>
    <h2>A hybrid decision making, prediction reward system</h2>
    <section>
      <p>The concept in brief: A voting system for deciding between alternate
      courses of action in which there is an agreed upon desired and measurable
      outcome. Each voter is provided with the same number of votes to start
      with, e.g. 10. Each voter may use as many of these votes as desired, all
      or none. If the desired outcome is met by the chosen course of action,
      <span style="">all votes cast are distributed to those who voted in favor
      of the successful course of action</span>. These accumulated votes increase
      the number of votes available to the winners (or correct predictors).
      The distribution of votes would be to the "losing" voters in the event
      that the winning course of action fails to meet the agreed upon outcome.</p>

      <h3>Motivation</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Want benefit of accuracy in outcome like a prediction market</li>
        <li>Need to make group decisions</li>
        <li>Not always feasibly or advisable to use a prediction market</li>
        <li>Prediction market is about outcome, not a decision leading to that outcome</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Problems with the system</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Too many votes in too few hands sign of good voting, could distort decision making</li>
        <li>People may have incentive to disrupt outcome because outstanding votes are at stake</li>
      </ul>
