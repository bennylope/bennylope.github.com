# My Setup

### Who are you and what do you do?

My name is Ben Lopatin and I'm a software developer and business consultant.
I'm probably the best Python developer who owns a Vizsla and lives within
walking distance of Carytown's Dixie Donuts. At least the second best. I have
nearly 400 Twitter followers, which is more than anyone else in my family.

I'm a partner and technical lead at [Wellfire Interactive](http://wellfireinteractive.com/), a web development
business with a focus on building custom web applications for small but growing
businesses with real, actual business models and advocacy focused non-profits.
Most of our projects are built in [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).
I also do some consulting of my own with a narrow focus on things like
architecture and process review, project structuring, and Django debugging/project triage.

I like traveling, reading, cooking, running, eating, beer, coffee, wine,
photography, dogs, cats, babies, friendship, family, local, sustainable, grass
fed, free pics, sleeping, Scotch, entrepreneurship, blogging, writing, high
quality leather, Oxford commas, and SEO.

### What hardware do you use?

I've got a 2013 15" MacBook Pro (Retina, natch) with 16 GB of RAM and, yes, a
500 GB [fucking SSD](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H7PJ1oeEyGg). The display
has a small burn-like area that isn't bad enough to warrant giving up several
days of productivity to fix and feeds my resentment for paying so much money
for a display that burns after less than a year of use. Otherwise I like the
machine quite a bit. I'm a huge fan of Apple's touch pads and I make sure to
put stickers on my computer so it's easy to identify me as a hip programmer
dude.

I've still got my old 2010 MacBook Pro that sort of works but only when plugged
in because two weeks after buying it I dropped it on a corner of the case and
damaged the piece of the logic board that manages battery health and opted to
live with decreased and decreasing battery life rather than basically pay for
another computer.

In my pocket I carry an iPhone 4S with a [conference
decal](http://www.djangocon.us/) on the back to hold
together the shattered back panel. I'd love to get a tablet to share with my
wife and am leaning toward a Nexus. The latest Android versions support
multiple user accounts unlike iOS, which is pretty important if you have
multiple people using a device. That, and if I get any more Apple products I'll
probably have to start wearing black turtle necks and going to WWDC.

### And what software?

The MacBook Pro is running Mac OS X (10.9). I'm super psyched to upgrade to
Yosemite and find out what hackish workarounds required for development on a
Mac break immediately after doing so. Much of my day is spent in [iTerm 2](http://iterm2.com/)
running [zsh](http://www.zsh.org/), [tmux](http://tmux.sourceforge.net/), and [vim](http://www.vim.org/).
It's all configured with [Oh My Zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh)
and [Janus](https://github.com/carlhuda/janus), because I'm not legit enough to
create my own bespoke configurations.
I picked up vim when I was getting annoyed with
TextMate and by the time I checked out SublimeText I was already sufficiently
productive in vim that I didn't care to switch. I have just enough vim fu to
make it look like I know what I'm doing. Occasionally I use
[PyCharm](http://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/), but only
when I'm working on non-Django Python projects. Its vim mode is pretty good but
I still can't quite move around as quickly in it as I'd like.

[Evernote](https://www.evernote.com/) is usually open in the background. I use it for notes of all kinds - a
technical journal ("how to exit vim"), call and meeting notes, project
planning, etc. I've also become a huge fan of [Dash](http://kapeli.com/dash) for documentation. It's not
the best place to browse documentation, especially that of a how to nature, but
combined with [Alfred](http://www.alfredapp.com/) it's incredibly easy to search for things like module and
function names.

I mainly use Firefox (Nightly and Aurora versions), including Ghostery and
Disconnect for privacy. I use Chrome and Safari as well, typically using
different browsers for different accounts and account types. If I want to use
Facebook I access it through a sandboxed [Fluid app](http://fluidapp.com/) instance.

I use [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/home) for storage convenience. That includes "important" personal files
which I keep in Dropbox-synced encrypted disk images. I was going to stop using
their service because they put Condoleeza Rice on the board and she was
responsible for the war in Iraq and then I realized I willing participate in an
exploitive economic and political system, populated with corporations with all
kinds of people investing and sitting on their boards and to remain even
remotely consistent I'd have to cut ties with any company or organization,
public or private, that failed to stand up against human rights abuses or in
any way shape or form aided and abetted or even implicitly tolerated state
sponsored violence which means I'd have to become a hermit but at least I'd be
a self-assured smug hermit.

### What would be your dream setup?

I'd love to use something closer to a 13" MacBook Air but with 32 GB of memory,
36 hours of GPU-battery life, and a dual monitor set up in my home office.
However I don't work enough from my desk to justify even a single external
monitor.

## BONUS ROUND

### What about dog toys?

After traveling the world and finding something beautiful and exciting anywhere
I went, it was hard to come back and watch a puppy just get bored with a toy
after a day or destroy it within a matter of minutes. I found that in so many
other things, like my name brand German chef knife, the durable American made
yard rake leaning against the back porch, even the deluxe Windex spray bottle
beneath the sink, I had trust that it was going to work and work elegantly.

When you have trust that a dog toy is going to stand up to chewing, and that
your dog is going to remain passionate about pursuing it, all your other
concerns in life just slip away.

A reasonable person would get moderately good dog toys, or maybe just a stick,
and replace as necessary. But we're not reasonable people, are we? It's
impossible to be reasonable and keep a Vizsla. So I did what unreasonable
people would do. I tested the dog toys, blind folding my dog so he couldn't see
which toys were which, chewing them myself to see how they feel against my
teeth, and thoroughly researching the design process behind each.

In the end I discovered the Chuck-It brand thrower and ball combination. The
thrower extends your range and energy, and the balls have just right heft to
carry through wind while not being so heavy as to become a safety risk. They
have a soft give to them combined with a durability that resists even the most
aggressive chewer.

Trust me, the result of spending so much time on consumer products in your life
is surprisingly liberating.
