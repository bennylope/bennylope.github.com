# Choose and document your license

Choosing and making very clear what license your app will use is a
simple step for many, but it's a necessary step and you should give some
thought to it.

## Why license

In the US, if you don't provide a license then by default it's
unlicensed. You own the copyright to work you produce thus no one else
is legally entitled to use it or share it without your express
permission. Kind of a bummer, and of course your mileage my vary based
on what locality you're in.

## Where to include it

If nothing else, declare the license in your setup.py file (more on this
later). Then adding this to your README file and/or to a separate
LICENSE file in your project root.

Licences vary in terms of copyright ownerhip, permissions extended, and
obligations incurred by users of your software. A "public domain"
license - which really isn't a license at all - is the only one that
amends the copyright. This license says, "I give up ownerhip of this
work entirely". Anyone else is free to use it, to share it, to modify it
- they can even put their name on it, legally at least even if that is a
douceh move. They cannot copyright it however or add any restrictions.
It's not common to release software under the public domain but there's
nothing stopping you from doing so.
