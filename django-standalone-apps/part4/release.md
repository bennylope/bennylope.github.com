# Release

-  regsiter
-  source publish
-  wheel publish
-  tag

At this point you should have an app that's ready to go, that's been tested
against several versions of Django and Python, that's documented, licensed, and
packaged to go. The next step is to get it released. If you've published the
code in its current form anywhere, it's been released. But what we're going for
here is release on a package index.

For the sake of instruction, and because its probably where you'll publish your
app, we'll use PyPI, ne√© the Cheese Shop, as our target system. Private package
indexes should work fairly similarly.
