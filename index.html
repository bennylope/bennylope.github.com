      <blockquote>As per the latest in thought leadership, we must refocus on identifying holistic synergies 
        and productizing them for untapped markets. Specifically, synergies which can be strategically 
        leveraged to cross-pollinate innovation across organizational silos. Each silo must 
        own its vertical to allow for unfettered horizontal growth and for the development of streamlined 
        efficiencies by bubbling up organically.<br /><br />The Zen of Business Jargon</blockquote>

    <h3>About</h3>
    <p>Princpal and co-founder at <a
      href="http://www.wellfireinteractive.com">Wellfire
      Interactive</a>, a DC-based web development firm. We design and
    build custom web applications and web sites. I build the engines
    behind those sites.</p>
    <p>You should probably <a
      href="http://www.wellfireinteractive.com/contact/">hire my
      company</a> if you're keen on building a sold web-application or
    designing a new site without seven layers of account managers.</p>
    <p>From time to time I get to use my extensive experience helping
    smaller enterprises design and deploy collaborative systems and
    processes. If the collaborative process in your organization is
    broken or absent, a vendor is trying to sell you overly complex
    software, or your company leaks organizational knowledge, send me
    your questions: ben [DOT] lopatin at Google's email service.</p>
